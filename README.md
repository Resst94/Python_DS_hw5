# Task â„–5

In this assignment for this module, we are doing a test task for a job application. 
Using the accelerometer data from a mobile phone, you need to classify what activity a person is doing: walking, standing, running, or climbing stairs. You can find the dataset in the archive.

We use SVM algorithms and a random forest from the scikit-learn library. We take accelerometer readings as characteristics, but to improve the results of the algorithms, we first prepare our dataset and calculate time domain features.

We compare the results of both algorithms on different features and different models with each other. We use the classification report method for comparison.
